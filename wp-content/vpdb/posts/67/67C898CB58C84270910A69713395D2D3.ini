<p>You just got a kitten or are about to get one. I know how excited you are but to give a kitten a good forever home you need some items. This article will guide you through the essentials and give recommendations from our store. If you are taking care of an  orphan  kitten, please check out <a href=\"http://www.kittenlady.org/fostering\">kitten lady's article</a> as this guide is intended for kittens from at least 12 months old.</p>

<h3>Food</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing to keep the little creature happy is food. A  4-month-old  kitten eats between 50 and 100 grams (depending on its weight). Make sure you have the correct kitten food.</p>

<h3>Care</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Kittens wash themselves all the time, they learned this from their mother. But even then we recommend washing the kitten at least ones every fortnight. Some added benefits are: the kitten smells better and his fur looks better for those Instagram shots! </p>
